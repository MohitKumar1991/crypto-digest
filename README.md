# Crypto Digest

Crypto Digest is a community powered AI that can generate summaries of what is happening in the cryptoverse. Most of the information about crypto projects is lost in conversations, interviews, tweets.


Current alpha deployment can be found at [this LINK](https://scrape-ezkddw517-mohitkumar1991.vercel.app/)

The goal of Crypto Digest is to build an AI solution that can understand information about crypto projects and 
1. Produce quality summaries delivered using a newsletter 
2. Build an automated knowledge base that can help people understand what is going on with these projects


## Open Source UI

The UI for this is in NextJS and will be open sourced along with the APIs (also in NextJS). This will involve all community participation as well as help from people in creating a quality data set to train the AI on.

Most general AI systems like ChatGPT do not understand crypto vocabulary wrong. So they get different things like names, projects and other information wrong and are not able to make sense of this information.

This problem can be solved by building
1. High quality dataset to train or few shot these models
2. Building a knowledge graph to help understand these concepts

Both of these things require manual intervention and are very labor intensive. The idea is to solve these problems using a community centered approach and release the tool as a public goods.
